    <p class="desc">My name is Arthur (they/them); I use ArthurArthur as an alias to remove myself from societal
        structures of naming. Though I have a legal name, I see myself as Arthur and nothing else.</p>
    <p class="desc">My work is a projector of myself and my body. They allow me to process myself and my needs. I use
        plastics and other stimulating materials as a catalyst for further growth. It’s important to me and my practice
        to talk about what I have experienced and how it affects my space. Queerness is infinite.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">My practice is multimedia and experimental.</p>
    <p class="desc">My projects grow into performances, sound pieces, woven objects, relief prints, ceramic objects, and books. I want to rewrite the unwritten rules. I want to question who I am and where I have a space. The narratives I am a part of help me feel more myself and in control.</p>
    <p class="desc">It’s critical for me to collaborate with other artists. The people who surround me, nurture me and shape me. They are as crucial to my art practice as I am.</p>
    <p class="desc">Currently, I am a student exploring visual design, sculpture, fibers, and performance at The School
        of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
