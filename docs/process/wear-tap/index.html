    <p class="desc">Upon finishing this piece, I found the dimension and volume reminded me of tulle. This led me in
        the direction of seeing this tapestry as also a garment.</p>
    <p class="desc">I tried experimenting with this as a sort of dress/belt. It isn't big enough to fit around me, so
        it felt like a body ornament more than anything. Either way, this began my interest in mimicking fabric with
        these plastic tapestries.</p>
