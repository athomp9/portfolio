    <div class="p">
        <p class="desc">From start to finish the process of this work was intense.</p>
        <p class="desc">The material of plastic as a surface to print on was utterly new to me and was interesting to
            work
            with. I’ve done a lot of work with plastic, but I’ve never printed with it. </p>
        <p class="desc">My priority was to make the drying process as smooth as possible. Because I printed on a
            material
            that was not absorbent, I needed to make sure I allowed as much time as possible for the ink to dry. Each
            page
            took a little over a week to dry thoroughly, and even then, there needed to be leeway if I printed too thick
            of
            a layer. </p>
        <p class="desc">The pages themselves are made of two plastic bags sealed together with heat. I chose a clothing
            iron
            as my tool for this project. The direct heat allows the plastic to form together and create insane textures.
            Each page was assembled and pressed by me.</p>
        <p class="desc">Mixing ink was a relieving part of this process. I didn’t have a single problem mixing colors or
            applying ink to the letterpress rollers. I was thankful I could rely on my inks and not have to worry about
            them.</p>
        <p class="desc">Setting the type for this project was so exciting. I was finally able to use some of the wood
            types
            that were available to me! Overall I think of myself as a pretty skilled former of type and its spacing, but
            the
            plastic as my “paper” made things complicated. Because of the warping of each page, the printed type had
            distortions that made the spacing look incorrect. During this process, there was a constant reconsideration
            of
            elements with my type and its word spacing. I was forced to pay even more attention to the legibility and
            aesthetics of each word and each phrase as a composition. This was an action that I grew to love. Having
            your
            hand in every decision made me feel even more proud of the outcome.</p>
        <p class="desc">The poem displayed within this book was challenging to write and iterate. At first, it was going
            to
            be strictly a third-person perspective of telling the reader their thoughts and feelings. The more I was
            writing
            and editing; I found that making a first-person experience the central perspective of this poem would
            capture
            the minds of more people. I saw myself becoming a part of the poem. Becoming a part of this conversation was
            difficult to navigate, especially when I was trying to tiptoe around a conversation during the chat.</p>
        <p class="desc">Putting this book together was something that I thought about the most. I had ideas of binding
            with
            a handwoven plastic rope, but experiencing making each page made me feel about bonding the pages together
            with
            heat. </p>
