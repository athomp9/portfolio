        <p class="desc">I originally scanned this tapestry in parts as a way of documenting it in high quality. I didn't have much documentation equipment at the time. I wanted to use the scans for animation, but that never led to anything. Instead, I chose to put them together in ways that showed the entire tapestry, or what I had of it in scans, but I didn't want it to be entirely legible as the original. </p>
        <p class="desc">Interested in the way I chose to scan, standing still and moving as the light bar moved across, I got these intensely warped images of the tapestry. I found myself spending time messing around and finding ways to join them togetherâ€”playing with layering and transparency.</p>
