    <p class="desc">This project was terrifying. I felt naked the whole time. </p>
    <p class="desc">This quote by Judith Butler was a huge inspiration for this project: "Gender reality is
        performativity which means, quite simply, that it is real only to the extent that it is performed." - Judith
        Butler.</p>
    <p class="desc">First, I want to thank the incredible artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soi_is_sauce/">Soi
            Sauce</a> for doing my makeup and making this project come to life. This piece wouldn't be as powerful
        without their hand.</p>
    <p class="desc">I found this blow-up suit online and wanted to play with how I could sculpt my body to exaggerate my
        hips and shoulders. The idea was to create over-the-top features associated with femininity and masculinity.</p>
    <p class="desc">I crocheted a headpiece using skills I gained from SOPHIE. The headpiece is meant to conceal my hair
        because hair can be a very clear distinguishing factor for gender.</p>
    <p class="desc">I wanted to create a clean slate without gender or associations</p>
