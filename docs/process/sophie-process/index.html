    <p class="desc">This ensemble isn't super complicated, but dear, was it tedious.</p>
    <p class="desc">The headpiece was crocheted out of clear plastic. It took a few tries to get the sizing correct. You can see images of the crocheting and myself trying on specific parts to make sure aesthetically things fit. Also pictured is my original sketch for the headpiece.</p>
    <p class="desc">The bodysuit is constructed out of metalized mylar. The garment is stapled together. The reflective surface worked in my favor: it concealed my body and most inconsistencies. You can also see my roommate trying the bodysuit on.</p>
    <p class="desc">Another material was a pair of black faux leather gogo boots. So included below is an image of me wearing them and layering with the mylar to picture the combination together.</p>
