    <h2 class="title">Monoprints</h2>
    <p class="desc">These monoprints are children of pure excitement and experimentation. They were created on a whim at the end of a past semester. I had a few leftover sheets of paper; I realized I had a few water-soluble materials that were ideal for this process; it was a perfect pocket of time just to slow down and make without care of how it would turn out.</p>
    <p class="desc">The effervescence of these prints is something that I responded toâ€”the pace, the graphic, the texture, the motion, the bloom, the exchange of freedom and form, the drag, the pull, the proof, the flow.</p>
