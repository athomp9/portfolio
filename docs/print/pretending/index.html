        <p class="desc">I experienced an overwhelming sense of imposter syndrome when producing this edition,
            completely doubting my abilities and practice. I got so caught up in the broken routine that I felt like I
            was pretending to be an artist. It felt as my practice didn't mean anything to anyone or myself. It was
            complicated. I found the only way to get me out of this headspace was to process this through a print.
            Screaming it through this edition was my way out.

            form, any shape, anything."</p>
