        <p class="desc">This book evaluates and explores our codependency with plastic as a global society.</p>
        <p class="desc">I have personified the material to create sympathy for its experience of being seen as garbage.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">Every piece of plastic is mass-produced and is made to look the same, but they all have
            different experiences no matter what. These experiences are lived through the individual in ownership of the
            bag.</p>
        <p class="desc">How would this bag figure out how to communicate with its owner? I believe they would use the
            language of their branding—mimicking the only thing it knows. I chose the visual language of bold letters to
            contrast and mimic the branding already on each bag.</p>
        <p class="desc">I turned this book into a series of phrases that join to create a twisted, riddle-filled love
            letter/poem. This material is erupting with heartbreak and hopelessness.</p>
        <p class="desc">This book is also a brief recollection of the history of plastic and its context and worth in
            our world—how we perceive it and treat it throughout and after its "lifetime."</p>
        <p class="desc">When experiencing this book, you are not only reading each line, but you are also touching and
            interacting with each plastic bag. You are "holding hands" with the handles and creating these intimate
            connections with this material as you read. You are becoming more and more comfortable in empathizing with
            the life within these pages.</p>
        <p class="desc">I speak about this book as if it's separate from me, but I want to acknowledge that I don't
            believe that at all. In many ways, this poem is me tip-toeing around a discussion of communication and our
            climate crisis.</p>
        <p class="desc">The poem:
            WE HAD EVERYTHING WE WANTED.
            HOWEVER YOU'RE FEELING,
            I CAN MAKE YOU FEEL HOW I FEEL.
            WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING,
            I CAN MAKE IT ALL CLEARER.
            I'M HEAVY, AND I'M LIGHT AS AIR.
            YOU MADE ME TO LAST,
            BUT YOU DISPOSE OF ME.
            I DON'T EVER WANT TO SAY GOODBYE.
            IF YOU WANT ME,
            YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.</p>
