        <p class="desc">This book is a visual narrative based on the poem “Brotherhood” by Octavio Paz. His poetry is
            featured on the edge of each page, as I believe every line heavily relates to the sequence of the pages. I
            developed a metaphor for understanding and explaining my queerness through the yearning of this poem. Each
            page includes a word or phrase which relates to a specific stage of my journey to self-realization. As you
            flip, each page increases in size, emphasizing the intensity of becoming yourself.</p>
        <p class="desc">Additionally, the reflection of each page is displayed on the back. This furthers the idea of
            seeing where you have been as you move forward. The abstraction of each phrase is intentional. Because the
            words are also important, I included a translation of each page on the back cover above the colophon.</p>
        <p class="desc">Page Translations:</p>
        <p class="desc">Emptiness</p>
        <p class="desc">I am lost</p>
        <p class="desc">Depths Endless</p>
        <p class="desc">There's a world inside me; there's a world inside you</p>
        <p class="desc">It's deadly & heavenly</p>
        <p class="desc">I used to resist myself</p>
        <p class="desc">I could be anything</p>
        <p class="desc">Visions in my head, feelings in my skin.</p>
        <p class="desc">Each page is hand cut.</p>
