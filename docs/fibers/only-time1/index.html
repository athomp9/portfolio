        <p class="desc">Since March 2020, I've been collecting the plastic bags from grocery stores and the plastic
            waste from packaging because of my finding that everyday thin plastics cannot be curbside
            recycled.
            This knowledge sent me on a spiral to just hoard all the plastic I can find and see what I can
            do to
            repurpose it. Through my material exploration and experimentation, I found ways to turn
            these <a href="../../process/plastic-rope/">plastics into rope.</a> This was the
            beginning of my wanting to weave with plastic. I've translated
            the
            ideas and techniques of traditional weaving to plastic. With this, I've learned new ways
            of manipulating plastic to create texture and shapes.</p>
        <p class="desc">These pieces are to recreate organic forms made of systematically abandoned materialâ€”a
            perpetual mimicking of conditions from our environment made of materials that are hurting
            it.</p>
        <p class="desc">Types/brands of plastic: target bag, jewel bag, aldi bag, michael's bag,
            mariano's bag,
            pet supplies plus bag, toilet paper packaging, plastic shipping materials, black plastic
            bag, clear
            plastic packaging, tan plastic net from fruit.</p>
