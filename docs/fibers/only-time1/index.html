        <p1 class="desc">Since March 2020, I've been collecting the plastic bags from grocery stores and the plastic
            waste from packaging because of my recent finding that everyday thin plastics cannot be curbside
            recycled.
            This knowledge kind of sent me on a spiral to just hoard all the plastic I can find and see what I can
            do to
            repurpose it. Through my material exploration and experimentation, you'll know that I found ways to turn
            these plastics into rope. This was the beginning of my wanting to weave with plastic. I've translated
            the
            ideas and techniques of incorporating standard materials such as yarn to using plastic. I've also
            learned new ways
            of manipulating plastic to create texture and shapes.</p1>
        <p1 class="desc">These pieces are to repurpose materials so that I won't be contributing to the mass of
            landfills. And in that this recreation of organic forms made of systematically abandoned plastic.
            This idea of mimicking conditions from our environment but made of materials that are therefore killing
            it.</p1>
        <p1 class="desc">The color and forms on the weaves are created intuitively through the process.
            These works are extensively process-based.</p1>
        <p1 class="desc">Types/brands of plastic: target bag, jewel bag, aldi bag, michael's bag,
            mariano's bag,
            pet supplies plus bag, toilet paper packaging, plastic shipping materials, black plastic
            bag, clear
            plastic packaging, tan plastic net from fruit.</p1>
