            <p1 class="desc">Since March 2020, I've been collecting the plastic bags from grocery stores and the plastic
                waste from packaging because of my recent finding that everyday thin plastics cannot be curbside
                recycled.
                This knowledge kind of sent me on a spiral to just hoard all the plastic I can find and see what I can
                do to
                repurpose it. Through my material exploration and experimentation, you'll know that I found ways to turn
                these plastics into rope. This was the beginning of my wanting to weave with plastic. I've translated
                the
                ideas and techniques of incorporating standard materials such as yarn to using plastic. I've also
                learned new ways
                of manipulating plastic to create texture and shapes.
            </p1>
            <p1 class="desc">These pieces are to repurpose materials so that I won't be contributing to the mass of
                landfills. And in that this recreation of organic forms made of systematically abandoned plastic.
                This idea of mimicking conditions from our environment but made of materials that are therefore killing
                it.

                <p1 class="desc">The color and forms on the weaves are created intuitively through the process.
                    These works are extensively process-based.</p>
