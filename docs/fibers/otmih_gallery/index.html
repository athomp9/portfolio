    <p class="desc">Since March 2020, I've been collecting the plastic bags from grocery stores and the plastic
        waste from packaging because of my finding that everyday thin plastics cannot be curbside
        recycled.
        This knowledge sent me on a spiral to just hoard all the plastic I can find and see what I can
        do to
        repurpose it. Through my material exploration and experimentation, I found ways to turn
        these <a class="link1" href="../../process/plastic-rope/">plastics into rope.</a> This was the
        beginning of my wanting to weave with plastic. I've translated
        the
        ideas and techniques of traditional weaving to plastic. With this, I've learned new ways
        of manipulating plastic to create texture and shapes.</p>
    <p class="desc">These pieces are to recreate organic forms made of systematically abandoned materialâ€”a
        perpetual mimicking of conditions from our environment made of materials that are hurting
        it.</p>
