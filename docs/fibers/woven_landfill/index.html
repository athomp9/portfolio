                <p class="desc">About the video: You are walking and stumble upon this installation. You thrash with confusion in trying to decipher all the materials, looking for recognizable forms and blooms. You back up, struggling a little. You center yourself and gaze from afar.</p>
                <p class="desc">I wanted to use this project not only as a form of collecting and reducing waste but also as a way of formally experimenting with texture and shape in real life and digitally. I was trying to translate layers and show movement in a way that might feel true to the point of view.</p>
                <p class="desc">The audio was an exciting part of this project. I chose to keep the audio of every clip at full volume. I think it pushes deeper into the visual and moves with it.</p>
                <p class="desc">About the tapestry: The tapestry is actually many tapestries put together to create a bigger and more immersive piece. Each compartment is about 18”x 24”. Though it may look otherwise, each tapestry is its design and composition. They hold a mixture of materials, allowing me to create complex and landfill-looking arrangements.</p>
                <p class="desc">I enjoyed inserting hard plastic containers and objects into these. I intended to make this as if it were just a landfill. One that is forever transforming, as are the real ones worldwide. Somehow plastics feel like gold to me. Thinking of our plastic waste as gold is the only way we will reverse global warming.</p>
                <p class="desc">2022, video of installed tapestries & images, 1:37, plastic grocery bags, packing materials, shipment packaging, toothbrush, electrical cords, mesh bags, clothing hangers, reusable and single use water bottles, smart phone cases, rulers, straws, forks, knives, spoons, caution tape, a shower faucet & connective tubing, etc.</p>
