    <p class="desc">I took pictures of myself and mirrored them on themselves. I then sculpted the images to resemble some iconographic shape of a dick and balls. There’s a clarity I have with these as different forms of genital articulation—a hypnotic connection with pleasure.</p>
    <p class="desc">There’s a form of transness that these hold. These are in constant movement. They are forever changing and moving towards their true form, yet they are content with the journey. I see profound beauty in these compositions—a love for queer bodies and queer sex. They are without shame or fear.</p>
    <p class="desc">I understand these as vehicles for addressing the current unease of my body and the roles that have been put on me because of my perceived body—a never-ending process of coming apart and coming back together.</p>
    <p class="desc">These phallic alien beacons are tools for pleasure.</p>
    <p class="desc">I am not trapped in my body, I am trapped in the way I am perceived, and I am trapped in a society that routinely upholds behaviors of torturing queer bodies and suppressing queer voices.</p>
    <p class="desc">I am freeing my body of shame—queer sexual pleasure as a togetherness of magnetic and devoted passion—not just bodies using other bodies.</p>
