        <p1 class="desc">Gendered or un-gendered bodies are defined by their features. A continuous cultural
            reconstruction strengthens binariesâ€”not just male/female binaries but all binaries. Gender-defined markers
            erase any idea of a gender spectrum or an ever-changing idea of the body. It solidifies the structures of
            bodies.</p1>
        <p1 class="desc">To start on this journey of understanding my body and my previously assigned gendered features
            and how to deconstruct them, I have to assign them myself. (remove features and reapply them the way I
            desire.)
        </p1>
        <p1 class="desc">The face feels like one epicenter for gender-assigned features. It's the first place you look
            when talking to someone. Because of this emotional state, face alterations can be the most noticeable and
            the most important for this project.</p1>
        <p1 class="desc">Because of societal norms, people find it "easy" to know a person's sex/gender by treating
            their face and expressive structures.
            Moving back to the ideas of removing and reapplying features, I want to create a body of work thinking
            through these ideas. I'm starting with the face.</p1>
        <p1 class="desc">I've created a mask that matches my skin tone to cover up my nose, mouth, and lower face shape
            in general. This allows me to start from scratch and build a new face.</p1>
        <p1 class="desc">I've recreated different features in multiple ways. These features will be placed and removed
            in different ways and in other orders and orientations to enable a continuous change in the body.</p1>
        <p1 class="desc">The transitions in this piece feel very specific and essential. They meld the cuts and
            movements in the video itself. There are, I believe, three parts where the video morphs into a vagina. There
            are a few instances where we put together lips and blush to create a symbol for a vagina. This feels very
            significant, almost as a digital SRS.</p1>
