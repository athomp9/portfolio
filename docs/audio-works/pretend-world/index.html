        <p1 class="desc">When I am on the train late at night, I can feel myself becoming a part of the train. In those
            moments, there is no distinction between myself and the train. Pretend World is a soundscape of this
            concept—the swift motion, the tug back and forth, the lack of control—an auditory ascension and descension.

            The video was produced using a visualizer that reacts to the audio. Soundspectrum developed this technology.

            artist work streamed consecutively online as well as projected live at physical locations in the Chicago
            area.</p1>
