            <p class="desc">When I am on the train late at night, I can feel myself becoming a part of the train. In
                those
                moments, there is no distinction between myself and the train. Pretend World is a soundscape of this
                concept—the swift motion, the tug back and forth, the lack of control—an auditory ascension and
                descension.

            <p class="desc">I created elements of this ensemble with an electronic modular synth, and others found
                sounds.
                The video was produced using a visualizer that reacts to the audio. Soundspectrum developed this
                technology.

                student
                artist work streamed consecutively online as well as projected live at physical locations in the Chicago
                area.</p>
